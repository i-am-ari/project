# Project Idea (1):

The aim of the project is to create a customizable homepage for busy students and professionals that shows when assignments are due on a calendar. It also has a dashboard of events that are coming up in the next x days (such as an assignment).

Think of it as a startpage that looks like a corkboard. It should aim to encourage productivity, but should not hinder the normal use of the web, which is to simply Google something.

## Requirement Thoughts (feel free to modify):

* It’s a webpage, as opposed to an app. It’s just the first page that loads when a browser is opened.
* It must load quickly
* User able to add/ delete/ modify upcoming events
* Events should be associated with a description and due date
* Events should be able to be marked as completed
* Events should always appear on the calendar
* If an event is in the  next X days, then it appears the Event Reminders section. 
* Events should be distinguished from things that have a due date
* Have a dynamic list of events that have reminders on it. Basically the block expands with the number of events due in x number of days. I would recommend hardcoding it as next 10 days to begin with, and then maybe changing it later so users can set how soon they want event reminders
* Anything due that day could be put in warning red in event reminders 
* Should be able to add an event at the Event Reminders section or the calendar section and it updates to both sections. Don’t want users having to add events twice - once in calendar, once in event reminders
* Should be able to change event colours in the calendar
* The calendar should display five weeks continuously, it should not have white space simply because the month ends on a Monday. * * May be useful to have the positioning in the second line in the calendar, so that people can see four weeks in advance, and one week ago’s activities at the same time
* Current day on the calendar should be signified by being highlighted or something
* Should be able to scroll through the calendar
* Background should be fun for the Event Reminders. Being reminded of tasks is depressing, so I was thinking of keeping the mood light and cheerful. 
* The meme section is simply uploading a photo from someone’s computer, like having a photo of your family on the desk. The idea is that it can help keep the study-space light.
* Favourite links section is to promote productivity (idea is that if there is an impending deadline, that a closeby link to uni website will encourage student to do some study)
* Meme/ favourite quote thing is optional. Maybe it would be better for the page if the Favourite Links block and the Meme block were swapped around for ease of use
* I was thinking the style could be reminiscent of a corkboard with the blocks acting as notes on it. Again, adding to the charm of it being a customizable space because the blocks would be like post-it notes and photos - a collage if you will- of items.
